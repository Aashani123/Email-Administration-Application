This is a simple application that is created by using Java with referring SOLID principles.

Here I created the code to generate an email with the following syntax: firstname.lasname@department.company.com To get to the department where the employee works, a switch case was used. Furthermore, generates random passwords. Have methods to display the employee's name, email, and mailbox capacity.
